# AWS Web Server Deployment Project

This project demonstrates hosting two web servers (Nginx) on AWS EC2 instances.
🚀 Excited to share my AWS Cloud Project: EC2 + IIS Web Server (Default VPC Setup) ☁️
During this project, I successfully deployed and hosted a Windows-based Web Server using AWS EC2 — all within the default VPC environment, demonstrating how cloud infrastructure can power real-world applications. 💻
Here’s what I did step by step:
1️⃣ Launched two Windows EC2 instances in AWS
2️⃣ Configured Security Groups for HTTP access on port 80
3️⃣ Installed and configured IIS (Internet Information Services) using User Data automation
4️⃣ Created a custom index.html page for each instance
  ➡️ “Welcome to Web Server 1”
  ➡️ “Welcome to Web Server 2”
5️⃣ Verified successful deployment by accessing each instance via Public IP in the browser
